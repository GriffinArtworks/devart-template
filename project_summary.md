## Description

**What:**

An interactive tool to explore generative abstract art in a quick, simple and tactical way.  Give users a way to manipulate something that's traditionally only allowed to be viewed. They can explore the variations around that piece in real-time, or simply start in a new mining location and generate something new.

Potential takeaway (if they mine something they like):
1. high-res digital version.
2. Enter into free prize draw where they could win a real canvas print of it (e.g. one winner a week).

**Why:**

Provides an opportunity to think about some areas that I find personal interesting:

* Identifying a simple control mechanic that people of all ages can use.
* Efficient rendering techniques for real-time generation, needs to be quick!
* Defining a suitable search space: too much variation and it becomes hard to find something nice.
* Use of machine learning to help pick better points to mine from.
