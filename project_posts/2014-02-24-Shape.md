## Shape

#### One Patch - Many Shapes

**Instanced Drawing**

A nifty option since OpenGL 4.1 is the ability to do instanced drawing, which basically allows you to draw multiple copies of the same geometry from a single call instead of having to do it once for every copy.  This is great as we'll be potentially drawing millions of the same object to generate the full image.

```
glDrawElementsInstanced()  
```

Within the shader, the instance Identifer is used to lookup the appropriate transform matrix.  


**Parametric Shape Model - 6 point patch**

Time for some Bézier curves, infinitely useful for graphics drawing ([wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)).  The patch could be a more traditional quadratic (9 points) or cubic Bézier patch (16 points), but for simplicity sake I'll try a patch of 6 points:

![image](../project_images/shape/patch.png?raw=true "image")

The edges consist of 2 quadratic curves, after finding points along each curve, we can linear interpolate between them to get point on the patch (x,y) given parameters(u,v) where u and v are between[0,1].

**Basic shapes**

This patch covers basic shapes such as:

Quad/Rectangle:

Triangle / Pie / Arc:

![image](../project_images/shape/tri.png?raw=true "image")

Petal/Leaf:

![image](../project_images/shape/leaf.png?raw=true "image")

More complex shapes can be created from a composite of the above shapes.

Circles:

A down side to using such a simple patch is that circles have to be made from at least 8 arc patches.

**Trade-off vs other patches**

One advantage being that it's computationally light, however it takes more patches to create certain shapes compared to say a cubic Bézier patch.  Todo: compare performance between patches.  

**Lines with uniform thickness**

For lines it'd nice to keep a uniform thickness even after it's been transformed. So even if we squash, stretch or shear the line it would transform the overall curve of the line but retain the same thickness along the line.

Mesh vertices for the line are calculated from the post-transformed curve, along with the perpendicular vector of the curve tangent (tangent is the differential of the curve, can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)).

### Shader Pipeline

**Tessellation Shader**

To take advantage of instancing we'd want to the drawing of the various shapes above in a single shader pass.  Since there's potentially going to be a whole variation of scale to handle; ranging from tiny shapes to screen filling proportions, instead of calculating the mesh points first then passing it the GPU, we can make use of the tessellation stages in the opengl pipeline to do it instead and just pass the patch points to the shader.   

Philip Rideout's articles give a very helpful introduction into tessellation: 
[link1](http://prideout.net/blog/?p=48), [link2](http://prideout.net/blog/?p=49)

The following outlines the shape related parts in the various stages:

1. **Vertex Stage**
 * transform the vertex using the model matrix

2. **Tessellation Control Stage**
 * check if it is a line or a filled shape.  If the two quadratic paths are the same then this is a line: (p0,p1,p2) = (p3,p4,p5).
*identify the level of tessellation detail to use based on the size of the shape on  screen  ( global coordspace space ).

3. **Tessellation Evaluation Stage**

 * if it's a line, calculate point p via:
 
    ![image](../project_images/shape/tess_eval1.png?raw=true "image")

 * if it's not then, calculate point p via:

    ![image](../project_images/shape/patch-getpoint.png?raw=true "image")

    Multiply p by projection matrix. 

4. ~~**Geometry stage**~~ is not used
5. **Fragment stage**
  
  * sample colour from map. More on colour in another post.  

**Level of detail**

Vary tesselation amount based on the length of the paths (p0,p1,p2)  (p3,p4,p5).
In the minimum case for very small patches this will create single quad (triangle pair), and then subdivide larger patches to attempt to maintain smooth curves while trying to keep the tessellation amount down to a minimum.
