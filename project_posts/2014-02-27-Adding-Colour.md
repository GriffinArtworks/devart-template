### Adding Colour 

Some screenshots below after adding in some colour.  This was done by sampling from a 2D texture map, using the node ix (along x) and depth (along y) to calculate the position. Examples below all sample from the same test image.

I like the interlaced string feel of the last one.  It's interesting to think that it's generated from the same well-defined recursive structure as the rest but has a completely different feel to it.
