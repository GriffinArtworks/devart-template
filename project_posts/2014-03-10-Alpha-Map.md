### Alpha map + Reversing drawing

Added in an alpha map into the fragment shader pass (Passing through the tesselation coordinates gl_TessCoord.xy from the tesselation evaluation stage).

I've used a square shape following with the same test alpha map to produce the various output below.

Things that have been explored:

* Using a minimum size for the shapes.  This was achieved by adjusting scale of the calculated transform matrix. 

* Playing with the opacity can make it look more like watercolour or more like reflective paint:

(normal)

(multiplied alpha by 1.5)

* reversing the draw order, so the highest depths are drawn first, with the lowest depth on top.
