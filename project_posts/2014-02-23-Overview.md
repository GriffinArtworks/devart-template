## Breaking down the problem

We start by first breaking breaking down the problem of abstract art generation into 3 parts:
* Composition
* Shape
* Colour

(These parts are described in Concerning the Spiritual In Art by W. Kandinsky, if you're interested, it's a good read! )

Visualising this in a simple way, it might look something like:

![searchspace1](../project_images/overview_searchspace1.png?raw=true "image")

This space represents the possible variations of images that can by generate by using a model to describe colour, one to define shape, and another to define what composition is.
