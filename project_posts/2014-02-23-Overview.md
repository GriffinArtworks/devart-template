## Breaking down the problem

We start by first breaking breaking down the problem of abstract art generation into 3 parts:
* Composition
* Shape
* Colour

(These parts are described in Concerning the Spiritual In Art by W. Kandinsky, if you're interested, it's a good read! )

Visualising this in a simple way, it might look something like:

This space represents the possible variations of images that can be generated by using some kind of model to describe colour, one to define shape, and another to define what composition is.  The goal will be to define what these 3 models are and how they can work together to generate images.

To explore this space we can just start at a point and wander around. A small change in any direction should lead to a small change in the look of the image.

### Interaction Method

One goal is to make it simple to use all ages groups, so this means no deep menus, no complex command sets. The initial thought is to use a row of 3 physical knobs, each one corresponding to movements along one of the 3 axes. This gives a tactical and direct interface for the user to move freely through this space in a continuous fashion, someone could just walk up to the installation and start using it without knowing what to do. Since the knobs are tactile unlike touch-screens it allows them to interact without having to look at the controls and instead concentrate on the screen in front of the them.

(For public usage so needs to be something durable. Current thoughts: Griffin Powermate, as multiple can be connected to one computer)

The controls could sit at the top of a plinth along with a touch-screen (Android tablet) which can be used for:

* Form input with soft-keyboard(e.g for entering email address).
* Saving.
* Labelling of the physical knobs.  
* Any instructions can go here.
