### Something missing

After some time experimenting it became more apparent that there was something missing; it felt like there was too much of a divide between the fractal foreground and the plain background.  Fractals that were zoomed in on were fine, but when zoomed out it would leave a large flat  space on the canvas.

### Capturing motion

If we compare with real artwork there is presence not only the foreground but in the background too, and together they unify the piece as a whole, working to encourage eye movement around the canvas.

So how do we apply this idea to what we have currently? Well, we're already drawing the fractal over time so why not try adjusting the parameters of the fractal over this period in an attempt to create flow around the foreground by incorporating the fractal motion into the final image.

Random one I found along the way. The colour map is mostly made of black which leads to the sparseness.

### Going wide

[![image10](../project_images/flow/Capture42.jpg?raw=true "image10")

I really like this one, it reminds me of the crests of tidal waves.  The wide aspect ratio helps to makes this interesting too so the setup could be 2 ultra thin bezel panels in landscape to mimic that of a panoramic canvas art print.
