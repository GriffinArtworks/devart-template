### Alpha map + Reversing drawing

Added in an alpha map into the fragment shader pass (Passing through the tesselation coordinates gl_TessCoord.xy from the tesselation evaluation stage).

I've used a square shape following with the same test alpha map to produce the various output below.

![image1](../project_images/alphamap/alphamap.PNG?raw=true "image1")

Things that have been explored:

* Using a minimum size for the shapes.  This was achieved by adjusting scale of the calculated transform matrix. 

* Playing with the opacity can make it look more like watercolour or more like reflective paint:

![image2](../project_images/alphamap/close-up2.jpg?raw=true "image2")

(normal)

![image3](../project_images/alphamap/close-up1.jpg?raw=true "image3")

(multiplied alpha by 1.5)

* reversing the draw order, so the highest depths are drawn first, with the lowest depth on top.
